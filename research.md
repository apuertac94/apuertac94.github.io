[**Non-parametric Identification and Estimation of the Intergenerational Elasticity**](np_id_and_estimate_ige.pdf)<br>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The intergenerational elasticity (IGE) has traditionally served as the
primary measure of income persistence across generations. However, its
estimation has long been hindered by the unobservability of lifetime income.
We address this challenge by first establishing the nonparametric
identification of the IGE, leveraging family characteristics and partial
income data under standard missing-at-random assumptions. Building
on this foundation, we derive a consistent and locally robust estimator
using Neyman orthogonal moments that delivers valid inference. Our
framework enables comparable IGE estimates across time and place,
resolving long-standing challenges in identification and inference. Using
the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we estimate an IGE of 0.69 for
the United States.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
This paper examines how family background relates to economic mobility
for disadvantaged children. We use data from the Panel Study
of Income Dynamics for below-median income, multiple-child families.
Using a novel approach combining family fixed effects, Empirical Bayes
shrinkage, and SHapley Additive exPlanations, we identify which family
characteristics most strongly predict children’s economic outcomes
relative to their parents, holding parental income constant. Our findings
reveal that race and family structure are the primary predictors,
accounting for 35% and 22.4% of the explained variation, respectively.
While supporting the well-documented racial disparities in intergenerational
mobility, our results suggest that the role of family structure in
intergenerational mobility extends beyond the single- versus two-parent
household distinction.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
This paper examines the heterogeneous effect of precipitation shocks on poverty status in
Ecuador. Using gridded monthly precipitation data from 2007 to 2021, we define measures
for the excess and deficit in precipitation levels at the parish geographical level. Weather
data are merged with household socioeconomic information derived from the National Survey
of Employment, Unemployment, and Underemployment (ENEMDU). Our empirical findings
reveal that both excess and deficit in precipitation significantly affect poverty status, with
considerable heterogeneity across economic sectors. Variations in the Standardized Precipitation
Index, whether positive or negative, lead to an increased probability of poverty among
workers in the primary sector. In contrast, we find poverty-reducing effects in the secondary
and tertiary sectors, with their magnitude being shaped by formality status, urban/rural location,
and self-employment status. The analysis identifies per-capita household income and
labor earnings as key transmission channels, with precipitation shocks having redistributive
effects on labor income in the tertiary sector, while amplifying inequality in the primary
sector.
