This paper examines how family background relates to economic mobility
for disadvantaged children. We use data from the Panel Study
of Income Dynamics for below-median income, multiple-child families.
Using a novel approach combining family fixed effects, Empirical Bayes
shrinkage, and SHapley Additive exPlanations, we identify which family
characteristics most strongly predict children’s economic outcomes
relative to their parents, holding parental income constant. Our findings
reveal that race and family structure are the primary predictors,
accounting for 35% and 22.4% of the explained variation, respectively.
While supporting the well-documented racial disparities in intergenerational
mobility, our results suggest that the role of family structure in
intergenerational mobility extends beyond the single- versus two-parent
household distinction.
