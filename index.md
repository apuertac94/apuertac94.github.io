Welcome to my personal webpage. I am a PhD student in Economics at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. I am an applied econometrician, with research interests in intergenerational mobility and development economics.<br>
This fall, I will be visiting the [International Inequalities Institute](https://www.lse.ac.uk/international-inequalities) at the London School of Economics.<br>
I will be on the 2025/26 Job Market.
