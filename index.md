Welcome to my personal webpage. I am a PhD student in Economics at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. My work lies at the intersection of econometrics and intergenerational mobility, with additional interests in development economics.
This fall, I will be visiting the [International Inequalities Institute](https://www.lse.ac.uk/international-inequalities) at the London School of Economics.
I will be on the 2025/26 Job Market.
